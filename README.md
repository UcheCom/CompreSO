# CompreSO

## Description
CompreSO is a GUI application that employs Python libraries such as pillow and PyQt5 in order to compress image formats without lossing its quality. CompreSO was born out of a personal struggle, inspired by the need to simplify the management of application documents for individuals navigating the competitive job market. The vision behind CompreSO extends beyond being just an algorithm; it's a commitment to supporting and empowering young graduates and professionals in the realm of technology.
My aim is to provide a user-friendly application that addresses the storage challenges faced by job seekers. 

## Required Libraries:
* Pillow
* PyQt5

## Next Steps
Beyond this initial MVP which was built in 2 weeks, I would like to continue to add many more features to CompreSO. Presently, authentication and security features are not integrated into the CompreSO project. Futureendeavors will focus on implementing robust security measures, includingbut not limited to password sign-on and 2-Factor Authentication, to fortify the system's integrity. The graphical user interface requires refinement to enhance its visual appeal, aesthetics, and overall user experience. Subsequent updates to the project are envisioned to incorporate features geared towards optimizing scalability and performance.
If you have any feedback (ex: feature ideas) or would like to contributeto this project, please feel free to contact me.
