# CompreSO

## Description
CompreSO is a GUI application that employs Python libraries such as pillow and PyQt5 in order to compress image formats without lossing its quality. CompreSO was born out of a personal struggle, inspired by the need to simplify the management of application documents for individuals navigating the competitive job market. The vision behind CompreSO extends beyond being just an algorithm; it's a commitment to supporting and empowering young graduates and professionals in the realm of technology.
My aim is to provide a user-friendly application that addresses the storage challenges faced by job seekers.
